<h2><b>FLOOD ALERT SYSTEM</i></h2>
<br>
<p><i>This project is based on Arduino platform which is primarily based on C language</i></p>
<p>In this project we have used a Radio Frequency Module operating at 433 Mhz for transmitting the water level of river from transmitter circuit.
The water level is measured using ultrasonic sensor which sends in sound waves and measures the level of water from the surface by calculationg the time
in which sound waves returned. The transmitter circuit is placed near the river for measuring and transmitting the water level.</p>
<p>The receiver circuit is connected to 2X16 LCD display and a buzzer which goes off when the water level is alarmingly high. The receiver circuit should be placed 
near the villages so as to alert them of the flood</p>
